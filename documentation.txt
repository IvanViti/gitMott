Dias Documentation:

The purpose of this code is to explore the physics of coulomb blockades on a grid of nano-granules.

The code is split up into 2 main parts. The first part is an artificial relaxer to bring the system into a local minimum of energy. The second part is the main code which uses the "conserved order parameter marcov chain monte carlo continous time algorithm" method. First a particle is chosen based on its density of states (with probability exp(-E/kT). Then, its probability to switch with any particle around it is measured. The jump is picked randomly with proportion equal to each site's jump probability. This algorithm is repeated and values of interest are recorded.

Program only requires 3 files to run (dias.cu, dias.h, and input.txt).  

compiled using:
nvcc dias.cu -o dias.o

run using:
./dias.o input.txt

where input.txt is the input parameter file. Can be empty. All input parameters have a default, the important ones can be changed via input file. These are: Temp (temperature), muVar (substrate variance, XYvar (position variance),  tSteps (timesteps), L (average grid spacing), eV (applied electric voltage in x direction, relax (whether or not to relax the system), grabJ (grab current or average jump distance), lineName (name of 1D file , contains either current or average jump distance), boxName (name of 2D file, typically contains DoS), timeName ( name of file which contains how long the experiment took in simulation time )

  


JumpMatrix initialized with 999's since one doesnt know how many jumps there will be. Extra 999s can be removed during post processing. 


xyVar should be set between 0 and .5 for best results
muVar should be set between 0 and .05 for best results
